# Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This is where I am practicing and experimenting with various Java concepts as I learn the language. The code in this repository includes examples of basic Java programs, control structures, arrays, loops, and more.

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple Java files, each demonstrating different concepts of the language. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

- **HelloWorld.java**: The classic "Hello World" program, a simple introduction to Java syntax.
- **Datatypes.java**: Examples of different data types in Java.
- **Strings.java**: Operations on Strings in Java.
- **Arrays.java**: Working with arrays in Java.
- **TwoDArrays.java**: Introduction to 2D arrays in Java.
- **ForLoops.java, WhileLoops.java, DoWhileLoops.java**: Examples of looping constructs in Java.
- **Break.java, Continue.java**: Demonstrations of `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- **Switch.java**: Example of the switch statement.
- **MathClass.java**: Usage of the Math class for mathematical operations.
- **Inputs.java**: Demonstration of handling user input using `Scanner`.
- **Comparison.java**: Example of comparison operations and conditionals.
- **Arithmetic.java**: Demonstration of arithmetic operations in Java.

## How to Run

To run any of these programs, ensure you have [Java installed](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) on your system.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarerism/Java-Learning-Project.git
